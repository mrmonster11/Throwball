      <i><b>THROWBALL</b> is a non-contact ball sport played across 
a net between two teams of nine players on a rectangular court,
which shares alot of similaritie to <b> volleyball</b> & <b>newcomb ball</b>.
it may look similar but there are some fundamental differnce. 
The objective of the sport is to catch the ball without allowing it 
to bounce on the ground and throw it back on to the opponent's 
side of the court.it is thought to have originated in england,
descended from a popular game played by women and then exported 
to india via the<b> YMCA</b> who brought it  to chennai in the 1940s.
       After that <b>Throwball Federation of India</b> (TFI) was formed 
along with the Indian National Throwball Championship. 
By 1990 throwball in India had become a sport for both 
  men and women.</i></pre>
