<h1 style="text-align:center;color:teal;font-size:70px;text-decoration:underline">HOW TO PLAY</h1>
<p style="padding-left:40px;color:navy;font-size:30px">The game might sound easy but it isn’t. The players are trained in a manner that will help them adapt to their skills. There are many training tests that are conducted for the players to boost the way their game plan is. This is beneficial as they will understand the rules and work on getting more efficient by time. The game is more exciting than it sounds and has particular rules for it, which is illustrated below:</h1>
<br>
<b><ul style="margin:80px;list-style-type:square;font-size:28px;color:red;font-family:Garamond;">
<li>Throwball shall be played between two teams, each consisting of twelve players, nine of whom can be active on the pitch at any one time. The remaining three players are substitutes.<br/>
<li> Throwball uses rally scoring in which points can only be scored when serving<br/>
<li> Matches should be played for the best of three sets, each set’s winner being the first to score 15 points.<br/>
<li> Service is done immediately after the referee’s whistle at the start of the game and after a point is scored. It is done from behind the backline towards any area of the opposition’s half.<br/>
<li> Points are lost in throwball if a team fails to return a serve or throw such as by hitting the net of failing to catch the ball and then throw it back.<br/>
<li> When you receive the ball you cannot juggle with it.<br/>
<li> the ball is thrown at the person and it is caught by them, they need to throw it back immediately or within a timeframe of 3 seconds.<br/>
<li> When the service ball is being thrown, it needs to ensure that the ball shouldn’t touch the net.<br/>
<li> When the game is stared, the payers need to keep in mind that they cannot touch the net for whatever reasons but the ball they use can.<br/>
<li> While aiming or catching, players have to strictly use their hands to enforce their actions, their body or legs cannot be a part of it.<br/>
<li> In the case of the substitutes, their turn will only arise when they have to serve or in case of any injury which is again an exception.<br/>
<li> A timing break of two minutes is allowed in the game.<br/>
